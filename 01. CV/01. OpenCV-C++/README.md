# OpenCV-Cplusplus
This is an OpenCV-C++ learning repo. The code is based on the pdf file named "OpenCV programming guide".The code can be run directly by cmake.

Install OpenCV with ubuntu command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y libopencv-dev
```

# Requirements
Mine is :    
ubuntu platform 20.04    
gcc 9.3.0    
cmake 3.16.3    
opencv 4.2.0    
IDE vscode    
I dont know it will work on other platform or not......    

# How to use?
Step1 : Clone the repo to your server  
Step2 : cd a chapter folder  
Step3 : Run command "sh compile_and_run.sh", then you will compile the current chapter folder's source code and run the excecutable file named mainproject. The result will be saved in the workspace folder which may not exist in every chapter if it is not needed.  

eg :   
    git clone https://github.com/JasonSloan/OpenCV-Cplusplus.git  
    cd chapter1.3  
    sh compile_and_run.sh  
    ...Then you can check out the result or review the source code freely...
